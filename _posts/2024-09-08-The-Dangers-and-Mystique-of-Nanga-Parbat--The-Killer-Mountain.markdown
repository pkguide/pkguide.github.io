### The Fatality Statistics
Nanga Parbat's fatality statistics are staggering, with a death rate of approximately 21 deaths per 100 successful summits. This grim figure places it among the top three deadliest mountains in the world, even surpassing the infamous Mount Everest. The high casualty rate is primarily attributed to unstable weather conditions, frequent avalanches, and the mountain's notoriously challenging climbing routes.
In comparison, K2, often regarded as the second-highest peak, has a significantly lower fatality ratio. This is largely due to its more technical climbing requirements and the types of climbers it attracts.
