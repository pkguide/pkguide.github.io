Funded primarily through public donations, the temple symbolizes collective ownership and cultural pride. This section delves into the motivations driving citizen contributions, emphasizing how the temple acts as a rallying point for Hindu identity. Many individuals see their donations not merely as financial support but as a way to reclaim a narrative that they believe has been suppressed for years.
Social media has played a critical role in mobilizing public sentiment around the Ram Mandir. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have amplified voices advocating for the temple, creating a sense of community among supporters. This digital mobilization has also allowed individuals to share personal stories and experiences related to their connection to the temple, further solidifying the grassroots movement.
