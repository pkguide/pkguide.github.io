### The Sikh Influence and Ranjit Singh's Legacy
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, Lahore came under Sikh rule, significantly impacting its cultural landscape. [Ranjit Singh](https://more.io.vn/en/Ranjit_Singh), the founder of the Sikh Empire, played a pivotal role in shaping Lahore’s identity during this period.

### The British Era and Its Impacts

One of the most notable alterations was the repurposing of the Badshahi Mosque for military use, reflecting the broader impacts of colonialism on local culture and architecture. The mosque’s status as a religious site was overshadowed by its new role, leading to tensions among the local population. Additionally, the Hazoori Bagh fell into neglect during this time, symbolizing the disregard for local heritage and culture.
However, the early 20th century witnessed a resurgence of interest in reclaiming Lahore's historical significance, led by influential figures like [Allama Iqbal](https://more.io.vn/en/Allama_Iqbal).
